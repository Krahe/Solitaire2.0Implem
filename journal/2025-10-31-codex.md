# 2025-10-31 Codex Log

## Deck code guardrail work
- Extracted shared deck validation helper so parseDeck and deckToCode use the same source of truth for permutation rules.
- Implemented reversible base36 deck code capsule + fingerprint helper with explicit error cases for UI surfacing.
- Added Vitest coverage for duplicate cards, missing jokers, and out-of-range inputs to harden upcoming clipboard flows.

## Open questions
- Should the base36 capsule gain formatting (grouping, checksum) before wiring into UI copy actions?
- Do we want to expose the validation helper directly for UI preflight checks when operators paste manual decks?
