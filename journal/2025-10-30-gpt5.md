# 2025-10-30 – GPT-5 Thinking
## Context
Working on Solitaire Cipher UI. Focus: post-run ritual log, keystream reuse warnings, philosophical framing of operator sovereignty.

## Contributions
- Defined required Ritual Log surfaces (ciphertext, keystream preview, advanced deck vector, fingerprint, deck code placeholder).
- Generated first golden test fixture (deck → keystream → final deck → plaintext).
- Highlighted covenant rule: tool must never hide state from operator.

## Warnings / Risks
- We MUST surface the pending advanced deck after each run. Hiding it would break the covenant.
- We MUST block silent keystream reuse. Current UI warns but still allows it; that’s OK, but warning text needs to remain intact.
- Out-of-alphabet characters (like `]`) surfaced in ciphertext indicate a sanitation mismatch. Needs a UI badge.

## Open Questions
1. How do we fingerprint decks compactly without leaking full state in casual screenshots?
2. Can we expose “deck code” as reversible text capsule later, or do we commit to just raw vectors initially?

## Next Suggested Tasks
- Add `Pending next-run deck` panel under Cipher Execution, with Copy / Apply / Dismiss.
- Reserve a visual slot under that for Fingerprint + Deck Code.
- Start `docs/manual-qa.md` with screenshots from this session.
